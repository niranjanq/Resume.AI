# Resume.AI
Here I am building an AI application where it will analyze the resume on the basis of the job description.


Files that we intend to create are ``app.py`` with another file as ``analysis.py`` hat can have  the prompts
and genai model followed by the resume text
- `.env` to store the gemini api key
- `requirements.txt` to store the libraries needed for the app.
  

- Activate virtual environment .venv
- ``source .venv/Scripts/activate`` - use this script
